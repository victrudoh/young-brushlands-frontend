      We’ve designed a new way for you to invest in companies that share your
      vision of the future. We call it, stock baskets. What are stock baskets,
      exactly? Put simply, they’re a portfolio of company stocks that share
      similar characteristics, and they’re based on sectors that are trying to
      make a difference (think Green led or Mobile tech companies).
